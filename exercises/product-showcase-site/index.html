                    Cheerios is a cereal brand owned by General Mills that is made from 
                    whole grain oats. The brand was introduced in 1941 as CheeriOats, 
                    but the name was changed to Cheerios in 1945. Cheerios is known for 
                    its distinctive O shape and is considered a nutritious and 
                    family-friendly cereal.
