                    The game's campaign follows Task Force 141, a multinational
                    special forces unit commanded by Captain Soap MacTavish as
                    they hunt Vladimir Makarov, leader of the Russian 
                    Ultranationalist party, and United States Army Rangers
                    from the 1st Ranger Battalion who are defending the
                    Washington, D.C. area from a Russian invasion.
                    The game's main playable characters are Sergeant
                    Gary "Roach" Sanderson, of the 141, and Private James
                    Ramirez, of the Army Rangers, with Captain MacTavish
                    becoming playable later in the campaign. The
                    multiplayer mode was expanded upon from the
                    previous game, with several new features and modes.

                    Development for the game began in 2008, when it was still 
                    known as Call of Duty 6. It uses the IW 4.0 engine, an 
                    improved version of Call of Duty 4's IW 3.0. Infinity Ward 
                    was inspired by real-life conflicts when developing the 
                    campaign mode. They initially tested the multiplayer mode by
                    playing an in-house beta version of the game. Modern Warfare 
                    2 was officially announced in February 2009. Teasing of the 
                    game began in March, with short trailers being released for 
                    the game and, eventually, a full reveal trailer. The 
                    multiplayer mode was revealed shortly after. Two 
                    downloadable content packs were released for it 
                    post-release, each containing five new multiplayer maps, 
                    with some being remastered maps from Call of Duty 4.

                    <h2 id="gameplay-heading">Gameplay</h2>
                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first person shooter, 
                    and its gameplay revolves around fast-paced gunfights 
                    against enemy combatants.[2] The player controls a soldier 
                    who can perform several actions, including jump, sprint, 
                    crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights.[3]
                    When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter 
                    their heads-up display (HUD), denoting that they have taken 
                    damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, 
                    their health will recover.[4] The HUD also displays other 
                    information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's
                    current ammunition count.[5] The game features traditional 
                    guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and 
                    sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns at 
                    the beginning of each level, but may switch them out with 
                    another gun they find.[6] Some guns have attachments, such 
                    as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors.[7] The player can 
                    use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group 
                    of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat.
                    [8] In some levels, the player will be given special 
                    equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser 
                    designator.[9]

                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has three different game 
                    modes: Campaign, Spec Ops, and Multiplayer.[10] Campaign is 
                    a single-player mode where the player completes eighteen 
                    levels connected by an overarching plot.[11] Each level 
                    features a series of objectives to fulfill, and the player 
                    will often switch characters between levels.[10][12] If the 
                    player dies during a level, they will respawn at the most 
                    recent checkpoint.[13] Levels can be played on one of four 
                    difficulties, and each level can be replayed after it has 
                    been completed.[13][14] Spec Ops mode features twenty-three 
                    additional levels that can be played individually or 
                    cooperatively with a partner. These levels provide specific 
                    challenges, such as defusing three bombs within a short 
                    period of time.[15] If one player is shot down while playing
                    cooperatively, they will begin crawling, and can shoot 
                    enemies with a handgun. If they are not revived by the 
                    other player, then they will die and fail the level.[15] 
                    There are five tiers of Spec Ops levels, with each tier 
                    harder than the previous. Only the first tier is available 
                    from the beginning, as later tiers can be unlocked with 
                    enough stars. The player earns stars by completing the 
                    levels on one of three difficulties, with the number of 
                    stars earned corresponding to the difficulty chosen.[15]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiplayer mode allows players to compete against each 
                    other in team-based and deathmatch-based game types on 
                    various maps. Each game type has an objective that requires 
                    unique strategies to complete.[16] If the player kills 
                    three or more players in a row without dying, they achieve 
                    a "killstreak", which gives the player a tactical advantage 
                    during a match. These include a Predator missile,[17] a 
                    sentry gun,[18] and a tactical nuke.[19] Alternatively, if 
                    the player dies several times without a kill, they will be 
                    rewarded with a "deathstreak" bonus, which evens the match 
                    for the player.[19] A match ends when either a team or 
                    player has reached a predefined number of points, or the 
                    allotted time expires in which case the team or player 
                    with the most points wins.[20] The player's performance in 
                    multiplayer is tracked with experience points, which can be 
                    earned by killing opposing players, completing objectives, 
                    or by completing a match.[21] As the player gains 
                    experience, they advance in level, unlocking new weapons. 
                    The player will also unlock perks, which modify gameplay 
                    elements such as unlimited sprint and increased bullet 
                    damage.[22]

                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first person shooter, 
                    and its gameplay revolves around fast-paced gunfights 
                    against enemy combatants.[2] The player controls a soldier 
                    who can perform several actions, including jump, sprint, 
                    crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights.[3]
                    When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter 
                    their heads-up display (HUD), denoting that they have taken 
                    damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, 
                    their health will recover.[4] The HUD also displays other 
                    information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's
                    current ammunition count.[5] The game features traditional 
                    guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and 
                    sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns at 
                    the beginning of each level, but may switch them out with 
                    another gun they find.[6] Some guns have attachments, such 
                    as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors.[7] The player can 
                    use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group 
                    of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat.
                    [8] In some levels, the player will be given special 
                    equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser 
                    designator.[9]

                    <h3>Title</h3>
                    Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has three different game 
                    modes: Campaign, Spec Ops, and Multiplayer.[10] Campaign is 
                    a single-player mode where the player completes eighteen 
                    levels connected by an overarching plot.[11] Each level 
                    features a series of objectives to fulfill, and the player 
                    will often switch characters between levels.[10][12] If the 
                    player dies during a level, they will respawn at the most 
                    recent checkpoint.[13] Levels can be played on one of four 
                    difficulties, and each level can be replayed after it has 
                    been completed.[13][14] Spec Ops mode features twenty-three 
                    additional levels that can be played individually or 
                    cooperatively with a partner. These levels provide specific 
                    challenges, such as defusing three bombs within a short 
                    period of time.[15] If one player is shot down while playing
                    cooperatively, they will begin crawling, and can shoot 
                    enemies with a handgun. If they are not revived by the 
                    other player, then they will die and fail the level.[15] 
                    There are five tiers of Spec Ops levels, with each tier 
                    harder than the previous. Only the first tier is available 
                    from the beginning, as later tiers can be unlocked with 
                    enough stars. The player earns stars by completing the 
                    levels on one of three difficulties, with the number of 
                    stars earned corresponding to the difficulty chosen.[15]

                    Multiplayer mode allows players to compete against each 
                    other in team-based and deathmatch-based game types on 
                    various maps. Each game type has an objective that requires 
                    unique strategies to complete.[16] If the player kills 
                    three or more players in a row without dying, they achieve 
                    a "killstreak", which gives the player a tactical advantage 
                    during a match. These include a Predator missile,[17] a 
                    sentry gun,[18] and a tactical nuke.[19] Alternatively, if 
                    the player dies several times without a kill, they will be 
                    rewarded with a "deathstreak" bonus, which evens the match 
                    for the player.[19] A match ends when either a team or 
                    player has reached a predefined number of points, or the 
                    allotted time expires in which case the team or player 
                    with the most points wins.[20] The player's performance in 
                    multiplayer is tracked with experience points, which can be 
                    earned by killing opposing players, completing objectives, 
                    or by completing a match.[21] As the player gains 
                    experience, they advance in level, unlocking new weapons. 
                    The player will also unlock perks, which modify gameplay 
                    elements such as unlimited sprint and increased bullet 
                    damage.[22]
