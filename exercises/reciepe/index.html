        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <p><b>MAKING THE RICE CAKES</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by mixing sweet rice flour and salt in a large bowl. 
                Gradually add hot water, stirring with a wooden spoon or spatula 
                until the mixture comes together into a dough. The dough should 
                be slightly sticky but firm enough to hold its shape.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the dough to a clean surface and knead it for about 5 
                minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, 
                dust your hands with a bit of rice flour as you knead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough into small portions and roll each one into a 
                long, thin cylinder, about the thickness of your thumb. You can 
                cut the cylinders into smaller, bite-sized pieces now.
            </li>
            <li>
                To prevent sticking, lightly coat the rice cakes with sesame 
                oil. This also helps to keep them tender during cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rice cakes and 
                cook them for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until they float to the 
                surface and become chewy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the rice cakes and rinse them under cold water to stop the 
                cooking process. Set them aside while you prepare the sauce.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>MAKING THE SAUCE</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pan or skillet, melt the unsalted butter over medium 
                heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until it becomes fragrant 
                and lightly golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in the hot water, gochujang paste, and gochugaru. Stir 
                everything together until the gochujang is fully dissolved, and 
                the sauce starts to simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the white sugar to balance out the heat from the gochujang 
                and gochugaru. Stir until the sugar dissolves completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, stir in the grated parmesan and heavy cream.
            </li>
            <li>
                Taste the sauce and add a pinch of salt if needed. Let the sauce 
                simmer for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>ASSEMBLING THE RABOOKI</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                While the sauce simmers, add the ramen noodles and rice cakes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them simmer for about 5 minutes to absorb the flavors and 
                fully cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once cooked, sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the top of the 
                rabokki. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan, allowing the 
                cheese to melt and become gooey.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the dish with a fried egg. Garnish the rabokki with chopped 
                green onions and sesame seeds.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately while it’s hot!</li>
        </ol>
